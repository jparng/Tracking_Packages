# Tracking_Packages
This Application is expected to work as described below:

1) Scanning a new package: a.   Click  the  “Scan  New”  button.  The  application  displays  a  package  ID number,  the  current  date  and  time  in  “Arrived  at:”  textbox,  enables  the TextBoxes and allows the user to enter the package information (address).

2) Adding a package to the list of packages: Click in the “Address” TextBox to  transfer  the  focus  of  the  application  to  that  field,  and  enter  data. Continue using Tab to transfer focus to each field and finish address entry (City, select state using ComboBox, etc.). Then click the “Add” button to add the package to the application’s List<>.

3) Removing,  editing,  and  browsing  packages:  The  application’s  NEXT  >  and <BACK  buttons  allow  the  user  to  navigate  the  list  of  the  packages.  The REMOVE button allows the user to delete packages, and the EDIT button allows the user to update a particular package’s information. 

4) Viewing  all  packages  going  to  a  state:  The  ComboBox  on  the  right  side  of  the application  allows  the  user  to  select  a  state.  When  a  state  is  selected,  all  of  the package  ID  numbers  of  packages  destined  for  that  state  are  displayed  in  the ListBox  (below the state comboBox at the right hand side of the Figure).
